# Storytelling

## Why do you love what you do?
Since I was little I was a very creative little person. You could usually find drawing or creating something. When I was 8 I decided that I wanted to be an architect. It connects my love for drawing, creating, and technical knowledge I have surely inherited after my father, right? But at the last moment, I decided not to study construction at high school. Instead, I started to study engineering because it was closer. That and that my brother studied that school too were the only reasons. When I continued studying engineering at the Czech technical university I learned graphic design in my free time. Which I didn't have much of. It was something that fulfilled me. I was again doing something creative. I was experimenting, learning, trying new things. Every time, I learn new skills or finish a project, I feel proud. Proud that I am doing something that I love, proud that I am trying to get better a be better every time. I always try to outdo myself, which is something that everybody should strive for in their work.

## What do you believe in? Whatâ€™s your design philosophy?
It depends on what I do. When we talk about client work my main philosophy, which my client needs to understand is, that we are not designing for me or him. We are designing for his potential customers. Those are the people who need to feel connected with the brand. But I still try to be very creative with my work. To come up with something new which would work well visually and in communication. But it still needs to be a design that is timeless.

## Who inspired/inspires you?
I am glad that there is past tense in that question. Recently I don't have a constant wave of inspiration from one person or studio. I am inspired by all those talented people and the work I see on Behance or Instagram, but I mostly try to be myself. And I believe that is why clients are satisfied with my work and why they choose to work with me again.
But when I wasn't sure about my skills I was really inspired by The Futur group. They taught me almost everything I know. Will Peterson who taught me the basics of logo design. Aaron Draplin who was my inspiration for his approach to design. And many more people who I could write about for hours...

## Where does your inspiration come from?
I think that I would just repeat myself at this point. In my client work, I am inspired by many people and they work on the internet. I am inspired by the clients and their problems. I am inspired by their customers and their needs. Inspiration can be an idea that comes to my mind immediately. Inspiration can be that shop I saw on my way to school. Inspiration can be anything. But the most important thing is, that I need to be inspired by the work I am doing. 

## When was that aha moment?
I don't know. There is not usually an aha moment. I mostly have to work hard to accomplish what I want. My ideas don't come from an aha moment. They come from hundreds of hours of work and practice.
