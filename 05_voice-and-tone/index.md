# Voice and Tone

## Voice

I tend to have problem to grasp properly what is being told to me right away, so I try my best to make things I talk about really hard to not understand, doesn't mean if I talk to my friends or a client. However, I have to keep in mind to not overdo it, since I don't want people get the impression that I think they are dumb. I can also get really cought up in my speaking so I have to remind myself to pay attention and be aware of my audience. Make myself approachable is also very important for me, as I don't like my presentation to be strictly one-sided (even if I am the only one talking, I don't like the atmosphere of "I talk, you sit still and listen").

## Tone

I enjoy communicating with people. With that comes the responsibility of choosing the way I talk and write. Sometimes it can be hard for me in a professional environment, as I tend to make things personal and talk with people as if we were old friends. But I try and set my tone according to the situation. Additionally, I am relatively fast on swapping the desired outcome of expressions.
